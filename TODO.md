# Pokemon PvP Analyzer - Development TODO

## âœ… COMPLETED

### Backend League/CP and Shield AI Integration

1. âœ… **Add support for user-selectable CP cap (league) in the backend battle simulator and API.**
   - Allow 500, 1500, 2500, "no cap", and custom values.
   - **Status:** COMPLETED - API endpoint `/api/league/{cp_cap}` implemented

2. âœ… **Ensure PokÃ©mon stats (level, IVs, HP, Atk, Def) are recalculated for the chosen CP cap using PvPoke's gamemaster.json, not just the CSV.**
   - **Status:** COMPLETED - PokeData class updated to accept cp_cap parameter

3. âœ… **Update backend to use PvPoke's gamemaster.json for best moves and stats for the selected league/cap, falling back to CSV only if needed.**
   - **Status:** COMPLETED - Migrated from CSV to PvPoke rankings data

4. âœ… **Integrate CP cap logic into the battle simulator so all battle calculations use the selected league/cap.**
   - **Status:** COMPLETED - Battle simulator updated when league changes

5. âœ… **Add debug output and verify that the correct stats are used in battle simulations.**
   - **Status:** COMPLETED - Debug output shows CP cap being used

6. âœ… **Test league switching and verify that all data (moves, stats, rankings) updates correctly.**
   - **Status:** COMPLETED - All tests passing

### Shield AI Implementation

7. âœ… **Add support for user-selectable shield AI in the backend: Smart (30%+), Always, Never, and possibly more.**
   - **Status:** COMPLETED - 8 shield AI strategies implemented
   - **Strategies:** never, always, smart_20, smart_30, smart_50, conservative, aggressive, balanced

8. âœ… **Integrate shield AI logic into the battle simulator so all shield decisions use the selected strategy.**
   - **Status:** COMPLETED - Battle simulator uses intelligent shield AI
   - **Features:** Type effectiveness consideration, HP percentage thresholds, strategic decision making

### Frontend Integration

9. âœ… **Update frontend to allow users to select CP cap/league (dropdown or buttons).**
   - **Status:** COMPLETED - League switching via API calls

10. âœ… **Update frontend to allow users to select shield AI strategy.**
    - **Status:** COMPLETED - Shield strategy dropdowns for both players

11. âœ… **Ensure frontend sends CP cap and shield AI parameters to backend APIs.**
    - **Status:** COMPLETED - All parameters properly sent to battle API

12. âœ… **Update frontend to display which league/CP cap is currently active.**
    - **Status:** COMPLETED - Battle results show current CP cap

### Testing and Verification

13. âœ… **Test all features work together: league switching, shield AI, battle simulation.**
    - **Status:** COMPLETED - All features tested and working together

14. âœ… **Verify battle results are accurate for different leagues and shield strategies.**
    - **Status:** COMPLETED - Battle results verified across all leagues and strategies

15. âœ… **Test edge cases and error handling.**
    - **Status:** COMPLETED - Edge cases tested (0 shields, invalid strategies, etc.)
