3. **Create** a feature branch
4. **Make** your changes
5. **Test** your changes
6. **Submit** a pull request

## üìã Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git
- A code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pokemon-pvp-helper.git
cd pokemon-pvp-helper

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables (see ENVIRONMENT.md for details)
# Create a .env file in the project root:
SECRET_KEY=dev-secret-key-change-in-production
FLASK_ENV=development
FLASK_DEBUG=True
ANALYTICS_PASSWORD=dev-analytics-password

# Run the application
python app.py
```

### Environment Variables
For detailed environment variable setup, see [ENVIRONMENT.md](ENVIRONMENT.md).

**Required for development:**
- `SECRET_KEY`: Any string for development
- `FLASK_ENV`: `development`
- `FLASK_DEBUG`: `True`
- `ANALYTICS_PASSWORD`: Any password for development

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### Security
- Always validate and sanitize user input
- Never expose sensitive information in error messages
- Follow the security guidelines in `SECURITY.md`
- Test for common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, etc.)
- **Never commit sensitive data** (use environment variables)

### Testing
- Test your changes thoroughly
- Include unit tests for new functionality
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Ensure the application works on different browsers
- Run the Pokemon API coverage test: `python test/test_pokemon_api_coverage.py`

## üêõ Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:

1. **Clear description** of the issue
2. **Steps to reproduce** the problem
3. **Expected behavior** vs actual behavior
4. **Environment details** (OS, browser, Python version)
5. **Screenshots** if applicable
6. **Environment variables** (if relevant, without revealing actual values)

## üí° Feature Requests

When suggesting features:

1. **Describe** the feature clearly
2. **Explain** why it would be useful
3. **Provide** examples of how it would work
4. **Consider** the impact on existing functionality
5. **Consider** privacy and security implications

## üîß Pull Request Process

1. **Create** a descriptive branch name (e.g., `feature/add-new-move-type`)
2. **Make** focused, atomic commits
3. **Write** clear commit messages
4. **Test** your changes thoroughly
5. **Update** documentation if needed
6. **Submit** a pull request with a clear description

## üîí Security

### Reporting Security Issues
**Do not** create public issues for security vulnerabilities. Instead:

2. Provide detailed reproduction steps
3. Allow reasonable time for fix
4. Coordinate disclosure timeline

### Security Guidelines
- **Never commit sensitive data** (API keys, passwords, secrets)
- **Always use environment variables** for configuration
- Always validate user input
- Use parameterized queries
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Keep dependencies updated
- Test for common vulnerabilities

### Privacy Considerations
- Analytics data is stored locally and gitignored
- No personal data is collected
- IP addresses are hashed for privacy
- Consider privacy implications of new features
